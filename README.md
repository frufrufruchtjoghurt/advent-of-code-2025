# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

My [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) solutions in Rust. This repository holds a separate Rust project for each day and part.

## Run solutions and test code

Each rust project needs an `input.txt` file in the corresponding `input` directory. Simply create this file with your input und execute the project to see the solution.

If you wish to test my code against the example, please include the corresponding `example.txt` file in the `input` directory.

I cannot provide my input or the puzzle text which includes the example due to the [FAQ](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying).
