# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

My [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) solutions in Rust. This repository holds a separate Rust project for each day and part.

## Run solutions and test code

Each rust project needs an `input.txt` file in the corresponding `dayXX` directory within the `input` folder. Simply create this file with your input und execute the project to see the solution.

The project includes a simple CLI to execute the solution for each day with the mandatory `-d, --day` flag. Use `--help` for more information.

If you wish to test my code against the example, please include the corresponding `example.txt` file in the `dayXX` directory.

I cannot provide my input or the puzzle text which includes the example due to the [FAQ](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying).

## Benchmarks

You can run benchmarks for the implementations with `cargo bench`. Please note that my code is not written with extreme optimization in mind and is rather geared towards ergonomic and easy to understand solutions.
